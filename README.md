# Filter-and-Song-suggestion-bot
In this project, we recognize real images of emotions (Angry, Digusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprised) in order to classify an incoming image as one of seven emotions. After identifying the emotion, the bot then recommends a song that would be suitable for the given emotion.
